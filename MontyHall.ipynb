    "This is what is refered to as the Monty Hall Problem. When you initially choose a door, there is a 1/3 chance that the car is behind that door and a 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the host, who knows what’s behind each door, opens another door revealing a goat, the probabilities don’t change. There is still a 1/3 chance that the car is behind your initial choice, and a 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors. But since one of those doors has been opened to reveal a goat, the entire 2/3 probability now rests with the remaining unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you switch doors after the host reveals a goat, your probability of winning the car increases from 1/3 to 2/3. If you stick with your initial choice, your probability remains at 1/3. Therefore, it is to your advantage to switch your choice of doors."

    "In the Monty Hall problem, the probability of winning a car if you switch doors is 2/3, while the probability of winning if you stay with your original choice is 1/3 .\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simulation, the percentage of cars won from switching is 62%, which is very close to the theoretical probability of 2/3. Similarly, the percentage of cars won from staying is 38%, which is slightly higher than the theoretical probability of 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The explanation for these results is that when you initially choose a door, there is a 1/3 chance that the car is behind that door and a 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors. When the host opens a door revealing a goat, the probabilities don’t change. There is still a 1/3 chance that the car is behind your initial choice, and a 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors. But since one of those doors has been opened to reveal a goat, the entire 2/3 probability now rests with the remaining unopened door. Therefore, switching doors indeed increases your chances of winning the car."
